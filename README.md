I couldn't go on using matlab programs, and had to rewrite them in python, since I don't have access to a version of matlab anymore. It was advantageous, though: I am now used to writing in python (whereas I had forgotten the langage of matlab), and the programs seem shorter and clearer that way!

data_file_generator.py transforms at once the heavy raw data files of the Raw_data folder into clear and convenient txt files in the Data folder.

figures_generator.py creates (and saves as .png and .eps in the Figures folder) all the different figures.
